# Hungry Humans

For when you are hungry but don't care to make too many decisions....

If you don't want to make any decisions, it will search without and filters and give you the top rated restaurants in your vicinity.

It uses the geolocator API to request the user's current location and the Zomato api to get restaurant information, such as menu, picture, and resaurant page links. 

When you do care about the type of food you wish to devour, you can click on various cuisine types and it will just search for that type of food.
